## Overview

Contains classes that represent the API (interface and models) for `nrich-logging` library. The interfaces have default implementations provided in `nrich-logging` library but users can provide their
own implementations. Unless some overriding is required only classes from this library should be used directly, other configuration should be provided through property files.
